# MarketplaceService
This is the marcketplace of the Lisk delegate market project. It was made as a groupproject for Fontys. 

It was made with .NET Core 3.1 and will function as an API for the Lisk Delegate Market. To make fully use of the API it is recommened to also look at the other services in the project. The other services can be found [here](https://github.com/S65-2-project). If you want to see the live product it can be found [here](https://delegate-market.nl).

Via this service users can register on the platform, log in and update their profile if they want to. It also takes care of creating new JWT. 

## External sources
To run this project you will need to run the following services:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/re)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io)

## Configuration
This is an example for the appsettings.json file that is needed to configure the application. 

```json
{
  "MarketplaceDatabaseSettings": {
    "DAppOfferCollectionName":"",
    "DelegateOfferCollectionName":"",
    "ConnectionString": "",
    "DatabaseName": ""
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "",
      "Microsoft": "",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": ""
    }
  },
  "JwtSettings": {
    "SecretJWT": ""
  },
  "MessageQueueSettings":  {
    "Uri": "",
    "Exchange": ""
  },
  "Sentry": {
    "Dsn": "",
    "IncludeRequestPayload": true,
    "SendDefaultPii": true,
    "MinimumBreadcrumbLevel": "",
    "MinimumEventLevel": "",
    "AttachStackTrace": true,
    "Debug": true,
    "DiagnosticsLevel": ""
  },
  "AllowedHosts": ""
}
```

## Github Actions
The project runs on GitHub Actions with 3 different configuration.

1. All feature/* branches will be tested and build.
2. In addition to the steps of step 1 develop branch pushes will also be deliver to dockerhub and deploy to our develop environment.
3. All pushes on a tag will be deliverd and deployed to our kubernetes environment.   

To reproduce the Pipeline the following secrets are needed:
- DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN : The access token or password of the docker registry
- DOCKER_USER : The username of the docker registry
- GPG_PASSPHRASE : The secret passphrase that is used to encrypt and decrypt the GPG files
- KUBE_CONFIG : The kubeconfig file to access the kubernetes cluster
- SONARCLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN : The access token for sonarcloud

## Delivery
All the images are stored on DockerHub. These are also on a public repo and can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/s652/account-service).
All images with a SHA tag are development builds and versions with a version tag are production builds. 

## Deployment
The project is deployed to a kubernetes cluster. in de ./kube_develop folder are all the different kubernetes configuration files for the development builds.  In the ./kube folder are the configuration files for the production builds. 

- autoscaler.yaml -> this is the autoscaler for the deployment
- cluster-issuer.yaml-> to ensure there is a cluster issuer for the TLS certificates
- deployment.yaml -> the deployment of the service itself
- ingress.yaml -> the ingress that is used to access the deployment from outside, it is enabled with a TLS certificate
- service.yaml -> the service that exposes the deployment for other services and resources within the cluster
